# Problem Research

## Some short Storytelling üòÑ ~

![Story time](https://tenor.com/bfiZa.gif)

When we opted for this Prototype Sprint, we got to know that we would be
having a new 4<sup>th</sup> member (Kenneth) in our team for the Sprint.
Since the three of us (i.e Bhavesh, Devansu and Namrata) already knew
each other ever since we joined the community, we decided to have a
small icebreaker call with Kenneth ü§ó

We did it a bit differently by hosting it in the Metaverse using
**AltSpaceVR ü§©**We were hanging out in different worlds within
**AltSpace**, playing fun games üïπÔ∏è and we got to know each other ü§ó, our
interests, our favorite domain in Tech üòç, our hobbies. We realized that
we had a mutual interest for Nature üå≤, and spending time in nature. We
were also intrigued by the beautiful greenery of different worlds within
the Metaverse and we got into a deep & interesting conversation about
Nature, some of the nature trips we had made in the past, and some of
the major problems like deforestation, Forest Fires, Global warming that
were destroying the Mother Nature üòî

That‚Äôs when we realized that we could pick a problem from the Green Tech
domain and develop a solution/prototype for it. Our mutual interest in
Nature brought us together as a team üî• to build something that would
contribute to solving a real-world problem üíØ as well as something that
we would be proud of.

## Onto some serious Problem Research now üöÄ

![Time to Research](https://tenor.com/view/transformers-wheeljack-time-to-research-research-researching-gif-23672426.gif)

We researched some of the Problem statements within the **Green Tech
domain** and tried to take some inspiration from some of the problem
statements that the past **Imagine Cup** winners and some of the other
teams had worked on.

After some heavy research, we realized that we hardly found any complete
end-to-end solutions focusing on the problem of **Forest Fires** &
**deforestation**.

**Forest fires** are generally caused due to **Natural** as well as
**Man-made** factors:

-   **Natural causes** - Many forest fires start from **natural causes**
    such as **lightning which set trees on fire**. **High atmospheric
    temperatures** and **dryness** (low humidity) also offer favorable
    circumstances for a fire to start.

<!-- -->

-   **Man-made causes** - **Fire is caused** when a source of fire like
    **naked flame**, **cigarettes**, **electric spark** or any **source
    of ignition** encounters **inflammable** material.

A look at some of the statistics that we came across while researching
wildfires -

-   **About 4.7 million acres** of forest cover were burned in **2019**
    while there were **8.8 million acres** burned in 2018 due to
    **Forest fires**.

-   **Out of the total 7,12,249 square km** of forest cover, **1,52,421
    square km** (**21.40** **%**) is either **highly or extremely fire
    prone**. In **2021**, India recorded about **21,487** forest fire
    incidents.

-   In **Philippines**, **24KHa** of land has burned so far in **2021**.
    This total is low compared to the total for previous years going
    back to **2001**.

Hence, we decided to focus on building a prototype during this Sprint
that could help with **making early Forest Fire predictions** and
possibly preventing **a potential forest fire**.

Initially, we were a bit confused whether we should focus on the
De-forestation or the Forest Fire problem. To get some validation of the
problem and whether it was feasible to work on something like this or
not, we reached out to **Microsoft Cloud Advocates** within the
**Student Ambassador community** to get some mentorship.

We received the required mentorship through a one-on-one session, thanks
to the amazing Microsoft Cloud Advocacy team, and **we decided to work
on the problem of Forest Fires**.

## Problem Statement:-

<img src="https://tenor.com/view/world-earth-the-world-let-it-burn-burn-out-gif-18536996.gif" alt="Forest fire prevention" width="350" />

**‚Äú*A system to monitor Environmental conditions like weather, soil
temperature, soil moisture, sunlight radiation of a region, make early
predictions of a potential Forest Fire incident based on this data, send
automated alerts and initiate procedures to mitigate a potential
incident.*‚Äù**

We are focusing on **three major problems** for an **end-to-end
solution** for **Forest Fires**:-

**1**. **Monitoring and Detecting Forest Fire conditions**

**2**. **Early Prediction of Forest Fires**

**3**. **Preventing/Mitigating Forest Fire conditions**

In the next document, we shall focus on the various Solutions that we
identified based for the above problem statement.
