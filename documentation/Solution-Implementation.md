# **Solution Implementation**

After hours of brainstorming and going through various potential
solutions, we finally had the solution that we thought would be
efficient, optimal and can work. The picture was quite clear to us,
creating an IoT device that would read the data from nature and use it
to predict whether there is going to be a forest fire, display that data
and the prediction on a dashboard. If a forest Fire is predicted, a
certain Forest Fire mitigation system must be activated.

## **Internet of Things (IoT)**

### **Hardware:**

IoT is the most essential part of our solution, we wanted to design a
device that would have the appropriate number of sensors so it could
both detect early forest fires and have as small carbon footprint as
possible by consuming less energy. Looking at these needs, we designed a
concept, which can be seen in the following image. For the scope of this
Prototype Sprint, we decided to go for a prototype version of the
concept that would have only the basic and essential sensors. The
sensors the prototype had are:

-   Air Temperature and Humidity sensor (DHT11)

-   Capacitive Soil Moisture sensor

-   Soil Temperature sensor (DS18B20)

-   Sunlight Sensor (SI114X)

### **Code:**

The IoT device was coded in Python. The Yaksha device takes new readings
every minute. Each minute is divided into 2 parts, the polling time and
the sleep time, each of which is 30 seconds long. During the polling
time each sensor takes 10 readings, and the average is returned as the
final reading for that minute. The result is then sent to the Yaksha
Dashboard (currently, IoT Central) and is also used to predict the
forest fires, if a forest fire is predicted, the Forest Fire Mitigation
system or the “Forest Fire First-aid" is deployed. The next 30 seconds
is the rest phase for the device. The sleep time can be increased or
decreased as per the requirement.

## **Forest Fire First-aid\*:**  
The forest fire detection itself was not sufficient for us, we needed to
go beyond that and find a way in which we could mitigate or prevent
forest fires. For the first fire mitigation system, initially, we were
thinking of using drones that would carry the water and sprinkle it on
the affected area, but that turned out ineffective as there was only a
limited amount of water that a drone could carry. So, we pivoted to a
fireball, which on contact with fire or around certain degrees of
temperature, will automatically burst open and within a few seconds
extinguish a fire. This solution seemed very promising as these balls
are small, and a drone can carry many such balls. We named this Forest
fire mitigation system the “Forest Fire First-aid".

## **Dashboard:**

For the dashboard of the IoT device, the team decided to utilize Azure
IoT Central. The primary reason is because it speeds up the development
of the dashboard and makes it easier to connect to the IoT device. Aside
from ease of use, IoT Central provides a secure workspace for the team.
Featuring industry-leading security, the only thing left for the team is
to specify which accounts can access the dashboard and the team can now
make a simple, secure, functional, and informative dashboard.

## **Machine Learning Model\*:**

After live forecasting from Yaksha device, it is utmost important to
predict the early wildfire to take caution to prevent the fire by the
concerned authorities based on the warning generated by Machine Learning
Model which means it is key component towards forest-fire control.  
This model will be trained using meteorological dataset based on the
specific geographical location which considers several parameters like
temperature, humidity, soil moisture, geographical coordinates, etc.

Machine Learning approaches used in wildfire detection can lead to
potential outcome with better accuracy to mitigate damage caused by
fire-

1.  Fire detection and Mapping
2.  Occurrence of potential risks
3.  Fire behavior and effects

The proposed system will utilize the meteorological parameters to
perform computation using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random
Forest Classifier, K-nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision
Tree classifier, etc. which can lead to potential model with the highest
accuracy to predict early fire.

The following architecure diagram shows the complete working of Yaksha. This is a proposed model and is not a part of the prototype sprint.

*\*Note: The Forest Fire First-aid and the Machine Learning model are two
components that are currently incomplete as they require more research
and we considered them out of the scope of the Prototype sprint while
working on this project.*
